TOTLE — Frontend Developer Intern (Round 1 Submission)

Candidate: P.V.R.B.Chinmayee

🎯 Problem Statement

This solution implements the core requirement of the TOTLE Catalogue Management System: a TopicSearch React component that provides real-time, case-insensitive search and filtering of a topic list.

✅ Key Technical Decisions

Robust Filtering: The search functionality is case-insensitive and efficiently filters topics based on both Name AND Category fields.

Performance Optimization: The filtering logic is wrapped in the useMemo hook to prevent unnecessary recalculations on every component re-render, demonstrating an understanding of performance and memoization.

Aesthetics & UX: The UI features a clean, modern card layout with subtle CSS gradients and a controlled floating animation on the topic cards to enhance visual engagement.

Added Feature (UX): A fully functional Dark Mode toggle was implemented using React state (useState/useEffect) and CSS variable overrides, providing a polished and accessible user experience.

Accessibility (A11y): The search input and the theme toggle button use appropriate aria-label attributes for screen reader compatibility.
